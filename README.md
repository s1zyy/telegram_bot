# ü§ñ Telegram Bot: Introduction to Backend Logic

This repository marks one of my very first attempts at building a functional service. It served as a fundamental learning exercise focused on integrating with external APIs and handling basic request-response logic.

## ‚ú® Project Focus (Key Learning)

This simple bot demonstrates the initial understanding of:

* **API Integration:** Successfully connecting to and communicating with the **Telegram Bots API**.
* **Request Handling:** Processing incoming user messages and commands.
* **Basic I/O:** Sending responses back to the user.
